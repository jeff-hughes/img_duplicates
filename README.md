# Finding image duplicates with variational autoencoder

(At least that's the plan.)

This is a test of how to create a machine learning model that will examine
a set of images and determine which ones are duplicates (or more generally,
will determine similarity).

## Data

The data being used for training is the COCO (Common Objects in Context),
available [here](http://cocodataset.org/#download). The data is not checked
into the repo but will need to be downloaded into the `data` directory.
